## My own personal MP3 player

Having watched a tutorial by the brilliant @bradtraversy on creating an MP3 player with vanilla everything, I thought I'd have a go at making my own.

This one contains only four tracks right now, all of them originally performed by *Roy Orbison*. These are my own performances recorded at home.

Maybe a song request or two would be a good idea? Any fans of Roy Orbison out there?
